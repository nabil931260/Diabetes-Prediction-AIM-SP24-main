Diabetes Prediction AIM SP24
Diabetes Prediction AIM SP24 is a machine learning project developed for Spring 2024 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning coursework, focused on predicting diabetes risk using health metrics from the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. The model analyzes features like glucose levels, BMI, age, pregnancies, and blood pressure to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic with high accuracy. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment for early detection applications.
​
